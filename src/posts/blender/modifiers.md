## General Mesh Manipulation
  - Mirror = Mirrors an object across X, Y, or Z Axis
  - Subdivision Surface = Create higher resolution by adding points between existing vertices
  ## Hard-Surface Modelling
  - Edge Split = Used to define where smooth shading stops (Also see Mark Sharp)
  - Screw = Create a full object from an edge (Imagine a triangle turning into a pizza from a spiral). Turn on Calc Order and Flip
  - Bevel = Add Bevel to edges. Turn off Clamp Overlap, Profile: 1
  ## Sculpting
  - Multiresolution = Like Subdivision, but in steps. Preserves the lower Subdivisions, and can go back and forth between them. Rebuild Subdivisions can be used to Remesh or Retopologize Higher poly models
