## Layering
  - After putting a base color, we'd use **Layer** paint consistency when adding more color
  - Paint color, then wait for it to dry. After it dries, build other colors on top of it
  - Layering can create a more interesting color hue

## Wet Blending
  - Put down 2 different colors of paints, and with the brush, start mixing paint towards the other color
  - Need to use **Layer** consistency, or anything wetter
  - Paint dries more quickly the more water added, so we'd also need a **retardant** to slow drying time

## Feathering
  - Just like Wet blending, but using water to fade away color instead of blending 2 color
  - Can use **Glaze**, **Layer**, or **Wash** consistency

## Glazing
  - Use this to Blend between two different colors, with a **Glaze** paint consistency
  - Semi-wet blending essentially. The paints below needs to be dry first, before glazing another color
  - Just like wet blending paint can dry quickly, so use anything that work as a paint retardant (Slow drying time)

## Washes
  - A wash is used to paint the creases and recesses on your miniature
  - It can also be used to tint the color of your base/layer
  - Washes is used for **Shading**, Not for **blending** colors!

## Stipling
  - Dab paint on surface
  - Any paint **consistency** works

## Dry Brushing
  - Dry brushing only works for adding highlights
  - Uses no water, 100% paint
  - After putting paint on the brush, dab some of the colors on a paper towel
