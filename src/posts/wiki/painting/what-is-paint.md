Paint is made up of 3 basic components: they are solvent, pigment, and binder (also called medium)
## Basic Components
- **Solvent:**
  - Water, or anything that can dilute it

- **Pigment:**
  - Gives paint color

- **Binder/Medium:**
  - *Binder*, also called a *Medium*, is an additive that binds the pigment and solvent together. It's what gives paint its properties. *Acrylic* for example, is a medium
  - Basically a transparent paint
  - It makes it easier to spread the paint, compared to adding water
  - It weakens the pigment, but still retains the properties of the paint
