It's important to pay attention when buying food at groceries.
Although Nutritional Facts tell us how much fat and calories is in the food,
It doesn't tell us the density of nutrients and carbs inside

## Nutritional Facts

> - [Food Labels explained](https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/food-labels-fat-cholesterol/)
> - [LDL and HDL Cholesterol](https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol/foods-to-increase-hdl)
- Generally, you want to limit Fat, Cholesterol, and Sodium; and increase Fiber, Vitamins, Calcium, and iron
- A `%DV` is the amount of recommended percentage of your daily total intake
  - above 20% is considered high, while DV below 5% is low
- `Carbs`, `Protein`, and `Fat` are the 3 main components when it come to your body's nutrients. Each of them gives you calories, and they provide different needs
  - **Carbs** is made from complex sugars. It's slower to break down than basic sugars, but provide more energy. Carbs gets stored and converted as fat, when your body has an excess.
  - **Protein** is used for building muscles in your body. It comes from meat, eggs, beans, and fish. Dairy products also contain protein
  - **Fat** is your body's extra energy. It doesn't get used until the body used up all the available calories.
- Another factor in nutrients is `Cholesterol`.
  - Cholesterol is another word for, *"The fat inside your blood vesels"*
  - Fat builds up on walls inside your bloodstream, and restrict blood flow
  - Your body has to work harder to pump blood, if it's blocked by cholesterol.
    - This can lead to heart disease and other complications
  - There are 2 kinds of cholesterol. `LDL`, and `HDL`
    - **LDL** is bad cholesterol. it's short for *Low-Density Lipoproteins*
    - **HDL** is good cholesterol. having HDL in your system helps reduce LDL.
      - HDL attaches to LDL, and carries them along with it, as it travels your blood stream
      - One way of losing bad cholesterol is by `excercising` 30 minutes/day
      - and another way is by eating `Oatmeal` at least 1 cup/day

> - **BMR** is the number of calories your body uses to maintain vital functions, such as breathing, heart rate, and brain function
- There's a misconception that your body always uses 2000 calories per day
  - This depends on what activity you're doing. You might be using 500 calories a day, if you're just sitting down with no movement; far less than standing work
  - You can increase your daily Calorie requirement (***BMR***), by doing Cardio excercises
- If you're above 15% of body fat, the best thing to lose weight is `Calorie Deficit`
  - This basically means *"Eating less than what your body uses"*. Eat less carbs and fat.
  - As you eat less, your stomach shrinks, and reduce the feeling of hunger.
  - Just because you limit your calorie, doesn't mean you don't eat carbs.
    - Eating `Low Calorie Density` foods can fill you up, without gaining a lot of calories
- Combine this with doing Cardio excercise, your body can use more calories, while reducing the calorie intake, therefore using the stored fat


## Below 15% Body Fat

When you're finally at 15% or below, you need to replace the different strategy to lose weight
- Reduce fat, as much as possible, below the daily recommended
- Replace fat intake with carbs, so you have the energy to create muscle,
- Also have as much protein to help your body build muscle
- The reason is, your body is trying to protect fat from burning, since it's an emergency source of energy.
  - When your body doesn't use fat or carbs, it starts to eat away your muscles
  - This is wouldn't affect people above 15% body fat
- Not every part of your body will lose fat equally
  - Fat prioritizes *first*: your Arm, Face, Shoulder, Chest, and then your Belly
